# project-long_range_axon_projections
Modeling of long range axonal projections from cortex to deep white matter


## Workflow

- Prepare domain surface init. Prepare WM and GM
- prepare domain surface deep. Prepare deep WM.
- prepare domain surface. Prepare the volume mesh for the three surfaces.

- laplace solve to generate the projections.
- evaluate_projections to evaluate.
